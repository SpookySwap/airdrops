# Discord Airdrop

qualified-users-discord-airdrop-1.txt - superset of all qualified discord users for the first 1% allocated to the discord airdrop
- 1% of the Total Max Supply of $BOO, split equally, will be distributed to anyone with the Community Member role, which is received by reacting to the rules in the #rules channel.

qualified-users-discord-airdrop-2.txt - subset of discord users for the second 1% allocated to the discord airdrop.
  The second set of criteria for another 1% $BOO airdrop, also split equally, are:
  1)  Have at least one role other than “Community Member”
  OR
  2)  Have sent a message in #📝governance  #🦟bug-reporting or the #🎨color-war channels.
  OR
  3) Voted on the $SPOOK vs $BOO poll.

  Color Wars was included as a mitigation to users who actively did not want to select a color role and represent light blue. This functions as a separate exception catch for "2nd Role" since selecting a color qualifies for this category.
